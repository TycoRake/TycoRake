# 👋 Hi! I'm Tyler Rakel!
I'm currently in my first year at Wright State University, pursuing a degree in cybersecurity

# Projects:
1. I am currently working on improving my dungeon project for CS1180, where the player navigates through a dungeon and fights monsters along the way
2. Currently working on a website with my sister, where the user can search up programming project ideas
